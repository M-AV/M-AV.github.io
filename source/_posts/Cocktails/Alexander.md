<img src="V1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

- **4.5 cl** Gin
- **2.25 cl** White Creme de Cacao (I used brown)
- **2.25 cl** Cream
- **1** Egg white
**Process**: Shake with ice and strain into glass.
**Garnish**: Nutmeg

Has a weird aftertaste that I can't quite identify. Maybe it's due to my cheap ingredients or maybe that's just the way it is. Otherwise it's good.
