- **6 cl** Strawberry Juice
- **6 cl** Light Rum
- **0.75 cl** Lime Juice
- **1.25 cl** Simple Syrup
- **1** Pinch of salt
**Process**: Blend + strain strawberries and pour into ice cube mold (small cubes of 3 cl each). When frozen take 2 cubes and shake remaining ingredients with those (no regular ice). When fuly melted, pour into glass. Alternatively, (if you don't have fresh strawberries) take 75 g of frozen strawberries and 15 g of regular ice and blend it. 

Wanted to make the *Strawberry Bandito* from Liquid Intelligence (p.147), but I wanted to make a lot of it (see image) and didn't want to use all of my somewhat expensive tequila bottle. So swapped it out with light rum and then it basically became a Strawberry Daiquiri.

*IDEA*: Try a 'proper' Strawberry Daiquiri.
