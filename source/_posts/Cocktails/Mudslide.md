 **Process**: Mix in glass, Shake with ice, blend with vanilla ice-cream.. Up to you

Some recipes call for Heavy Cream. Difford's recommend blending it with vanilla ice cream.

It's a coffee'ish dessert, very similar to a White Russian or a Screaming Orgasm. If using ice cream I guess it will only be even more of a dessert. Delicious, easy to drink.
