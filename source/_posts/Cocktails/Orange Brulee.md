 - **45 ml** Amaretto
 - **45 ml** Grand Marnier liqueur
 - **22.5 ml** Cognac
 - **7.5 ml** Cream
 **Garnish**: Cream and grated chocolate or nutmeg
 **Process**: Stir first 3 ingredients and float cream on top

It's quite strong. The cream counters it a bit, but maybe not enough? The Amaretto comes through quite clearly initially with the strong alcohol coming in afterwards (not sure if it's the Cognac or the Grand Marnier I can taste mostly).

It's good, but will not be a go to cocktail due to the "strongness" of it.
