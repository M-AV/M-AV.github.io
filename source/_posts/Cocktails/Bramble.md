<img src="V1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

- **4.5 cl** Gin
- **3 cl** Lemon Juice
- **1.5 cl** Simple Syrup
- **1.25 cl** Creme de Mure
**Process**: Shake Gin, Lemon and Simple with ice and strain into glass with crushed ice. Top glass with crushed ice and pour Creme de Mure over it.

I used small ice balls instead of crushed ice. Worked out fine.

*IDEA*: Play around with Simple and Mure quantities. It was quite sweet, but not sure if it was too sweet.
