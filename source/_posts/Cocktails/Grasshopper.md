<img src="Grasshopper_V1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

 - **5 cl** Clear Creme de Cacao
 - **3 cl** Green Créme de Menthe
 - **4 cl** Cream
     

**Process**: Shake and strain
**Garnish**: Grated Chocolate or Nutmeg

I had given up on this one after trying the Rum verion (See attempt 1). Then I saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV7Wv8yva_s) How to Drink video with an alternative recipe. It's much better.

## Attempt 2
<img src="Grasshopper_V2.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

 - **4 cl** Brown Creme de Cacao (Didn't have clear)
 - **4 cl** Green Créme de Menthe
 - **4 cl** Cream

**Process**: Shake and strain

Much better than 1st attempt. Creamy. Minty. Chocolatey. What's not to like? Maybe a bit too minty.

**Idea**: *Try to use more Cacao than Menthe. Don't know if it was due to the quality of the Menthe, but it was a bit too minty.*

## Attempt 1
<img src="Grasshopper_V1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

 - **3 cl** White Rum 
 - **3 cl** Green Créme de Menthe
 - **3 cl** Cream

   
 Good idea. I don't like the aftertaste.. Maybe it's the rum?   
 Need more to fill my glass (see attempt 1)
