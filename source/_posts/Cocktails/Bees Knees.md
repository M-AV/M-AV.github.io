<img src="V3.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

 - **60 ml** Gin 
 - **30 ml** Lemon Juice
 - **30 ml** [Honey Syrup](/Cocktails/Sirups.html) 
 - **15 ml** Orange Juice
**Process**: Shake everything with ice and strain into glass.

Delicious. I used a 2:1 honey syrup. You can taste the honey and the orange. Slightly more syrup than most recipes I have seen, but I don't feel it's too sweet.

Other recipe (Needs adjusting):

 - 5cl Gin
 - 3cl Lemon Juice
 - 2cl Acacia Honey
 - 1cl Simple Syrup
 - 1 egg white


*IDEA*: Try the other recipe with egg white and see if it's equally good.

## Attempt 3

 - **60 ml** Gin 
 - **30 ml** Lemon Juice
 - **30 ml** [Honey Syrup](/Cocktails/Sirups.html)
 - **15 ml** Orange Juice
 

<p style="clear: right; display: block;"></p>

## Attempt 1 & 2 

<img src="Bees_Knees_v1.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: right;">

 - **60 ml**/**40 ml** Dry Gin 
 - **22.5 ml** Lemon Juice
 - **15 ml** [Honey Syrup](/Cocktails/Sirups.html)
 - **10 ml** Orange Juice
    

 Double up on everything to fill rock glass. Was way too boozy. 120 ml gin in one glass is just too much.

 Tried again with **80 ml** Gin (again a double up) and it was much better. A bit sour. That could be because of the lemons. 

 Next time, maybe try to add a bit more syrup to counter the sourness better (or make a sweeter syrup - maybe the honey I used isn't suited for the 64g/100g ratio)
