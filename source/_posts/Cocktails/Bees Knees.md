# Bee's Knees ([Supercall](https://www.supercall.com/recipe/bees-knees), Difford's [#1](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/195/bees-knees-1), [#2](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/196/bees-knees-2) & [#3](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/2144/bees-knees-3))

## Attempt 1 & 2 
Source: [Difford's Guide](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/2144/bees-knees)

 - **60 ml**/**40 ml** Dry Gin 
 - **22.5 ml** Lemon Juice
 - **15 ml** Honey Syrup (homemade mixed 64g honey to 100g water)
 - **10 ml** Orange Juice

 Double up on everything to fill rock glass. Was way too boozy. 120 ml gin in one glass is just too much.

 Tried again with **40 ml** Gin (again a double up) and it was much better. A bit sour. That could be because of the lemons. 

 Next time, maybe try to add a bit more syrup to counter the sourness better (or make a sweeter syrup - maybe the honey I used isn't suited for the 64g/100g ratio)
