 - **60 ml**/**40 ml** Dry Gin 
 - **22.5 ml** Lemon Juice
 - **15 ml** [Honey Syrup](/Cocktails/Sirups.html)
 - **10 ml** Orange Juice

Other recipe

 - 5cl Gin
 - 3cl Lemon Juice
 - 2cl Acacia Honey
 - 1cl Simple Syrup
 - 1 egg white

## Attempt 1 & 2 
 - **60 ml**/**40 ml** Dry Gin 
 - **22.5 ml** Lemon Juice
 - **15 ml** [Honey Syrup](/Cocktails/Sirups.html)
 - **10 ml** Orange Juice
    

 Double up on everything to fill rock glass. Was way too boozy. 120 ml gin in one glass is just too much.

 Tried again with **80 ml** Gin (again a double up) and it was much better. A bit sour. That could be because of the lemons. 

 Next time, maybe try to add a bit more syrup to counter the sourness better (or make a sweeter syrup - maybe the honey I used isn't suited for the 64g/100g ratio)
