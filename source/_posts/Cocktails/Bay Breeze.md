 - **60 ml** Vodka
 - **90 ml** Pineapple Juice
 - **90 ml** Cranberry Juice
 **Process**: Fill highball glass with ice, add Vodka, Pineapple and Cranberry. Stir a bit 

 Simple and easy to drink. Quite refreshing. The pineapple really comes through, the cranberry not so much. Except maybe making it a bit less sweet.
