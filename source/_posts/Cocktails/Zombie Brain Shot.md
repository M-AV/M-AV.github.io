 - **½ shot** Peach Schnapps
 - **1/4 shot** Green Creme de Menthe
 - **1/4 shot** Bailey's Irish Cream
 - **a bit** Grenadine Sirup

**Process**: Put Peach Schnapps in shot glass. Add some Green Creme de Menthe for the color. Layer Bailey's on top until glass is almost full. In the end, squirt some Grenadine sirup through the Bailey's to create the "brainy" effect (it needs a bit of force to get properly through)

**Comment**: Creates a super cool looking effect. It taste fine as well, but the coagulated cream is not fun to  drink.
