- **3 cl** Citron Vodka
- **3 cl** Cointreau
- **4.5 cl** Cranberry Juice
- **1.5 cl** Lime Juice
- **1 dash** Orange bitters
**Process**: Shake everything with ice and strain into glass

[Difford's](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/472/cosmopolitan-cocktail-diffords-recipe) ratio.
Nicely balanced Cranberry / Citrus drink. You can use normal vodka, but it seems a bit too sweet without it. Might be fixable with a bit more Lime.

*IDEA*: Try out some of the other variants from Difford's, H2D or Liq.Int (p.130)

For some reason I missed the lime when reading the recipe. Would have helped a lot in this one.
