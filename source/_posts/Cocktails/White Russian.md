- **4 cl** Vodka
- **4 cl** Kahlua
- **4 cl** Cream
- Nutmeg for Garnish

Mix Vodka + Kahlua in glass with ice. Layer cream on top to taste.

**Idea**:  *Shake 1.5-2cl Amaretto with cream*
**Idea**:  *Reduce amount of cream (see picture)*
**Idea**:  *Try alternative ratio (e.g. 5cl Vodka, 4cl Kahlua, 3cl Cream)*

## Attempt 1 (w. Amaretto)

 - **4 cl** Vodka
 - **4 cl** Kahlua
 - **4 cl** Cream
 - **1 cl** Amaretto
 - Nutmeg for Garnish

Kahlua & Vodka in glass with ice. Shake cream with Amaretto and an ice cube and floated on top. Shake to give a slightly more whipped texture.   

The Amaretto was recommended by someone on Reddit, but didn't really make a difference.

**Idea**:  *Shake 1.5-2cl Amaretto with cream*
**Idea**:  *Reduce amount of cream (see picture)*
