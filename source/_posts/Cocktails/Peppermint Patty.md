 - **?? ml** Hot chocolate
 - **30 ml** Peppermint Schnapps
 - **15 ml** Dark Creme de Cacao
 - **5 ml** Creme de Menthe

**Process**: Mix in glass or thermice

From the animated TV show 'Archer'.

**Comment**: Not sure what the difference is between the Peppermint Schnapps and the Creme de Menthe. The ones I have taste mostly similar, so the "hint of Creme de Menthe" is not really there for me. Can probably make the same drink without it.
