Source: [Difford's](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/845/gin-sour), based mine on the Whiskey Sour recipe

 - 2x Gin (I used Nouaison)
 - 3/4x Lemon Juice
 - ½x Rich Simple Syrup
 - 1 egg white
 - 3-4 drops of Angustora Aromatic Bitters

Shake (well) all ingredients with ice, strain into glass. Put a few drops of bitters on top of the foam.  
**Comment**: Quite good, You can clearly smell the gin. Maybe a tad more sour than the Whiskey Sour.
