 - 2x Gin
 - 3/4x Lemon Juice
 - ½x Rich Simple Syrup
 - 1 egg white
 - 3-4 drops of Angustora Aromatic Bitters

**Process**: Shake (well) all ingredients with ice, strain into glass. Put a few drops of bitters on top of the foam.  

Quite good, You can clearly smell the gin. Maybe a tad more sour than the Whiskey Sour.

Ratio based on the Whiskey Sour recipe.
