A variant on the screwdriver

## Recipe

- 6 cl Vodka
- 2 cl Amaretto
- 1.5 cl Sugar Sirup (2 to 1)
- Top with Orange Juice
- Add a splash of Soda water

*Forgot to take a picture, but it looks as you would expect*

## Notes
Quite good and refreshing. Can be made quite boozy since the Orange juice and Amaretto hides most of the 'alcolhol' taste from the vodka.
