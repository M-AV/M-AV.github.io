- 6 cl Gin (Can be made with any spirit)
- 3 cl Lemon Juice
- 1.5 cl Sugar Sirup (2 to 1)
- Top with Soda

## Variants
There are many variants of the Fizz.

**Silver Fizz**: Add an egg-white when shaking. Creates a nice foam head. With the soda you can easily adjust how 'strong' it should be. Very good.
