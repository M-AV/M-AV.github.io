Generally measure *by weight*. If heating water to mix, some water will evaporate. Consider adding it back in afterwards.

Add a tablespoon of vodka and it will last longer

### Simple  
 - 1x Sugar
 - 1x Water

### Rich Simple  
 - 2x Sugar
 - 1x Water

Same sweetening power as 1.5x of regular Simple Sirup<sup>1</sup>
   
### Honey Sirup  
 - 64g Water
 - 100g Honey
    

 Ratio from Liquid Intelligence. You should be able to use this ratio in place of simple syrup in any recipe.

 Other ratios such as 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 are being mentioned in a lot of places. [Difford's](https://www.diffordsguide.com/g/1109/honey-and-honey-syrup/honey-syrup) seems to prefer a 3:1 ratio.

 ### Berries
- 100g Berries (Strawberry, Raspberry, ..)
- 2dl Sugar
- 1dl Water
**Process**: Muddle berries with sugar. Heat water to just below boiling point. Add sugar/berry-mix and stir until the sugar is dissolved.

Didn't write down the recipe when I made it last time, so haven't actually tried these exact ratios. I guess the sugar should be adjusted depending on the sweetness of the berries.


### Coconut Syrup / Cream of Coconut
- 400 ml Coconut Milk (1 can)
- 375 g Sugar
- Pinch of salt
**Process**: Stir over heat until sugar is dissolved (color changes from white to partially transparent)
